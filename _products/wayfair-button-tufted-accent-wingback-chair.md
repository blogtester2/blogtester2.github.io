This wingback chair has diamond-stitched button tufting and welted details for a modern take on a classic look in your living room. It's made with an engineered wood frame, and it's built on tapered wooden legs with a dark espresso finish. This armchair is wrapped in a solid color polyester blend with your choice of color, and its seat is filled with foam and sinuous springs to support you while you relax. It also features recessed arms that add a dash of traditional style. To care for this chair, spot clean only and wipe clean with a damp cloth.
