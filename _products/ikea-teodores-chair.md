Teodore’s chair from IKEA is both boring and fun. Its striking white color will dazzle those who look at it. The white is so white, the chair looks like the teeth everyone wants to have. That being said, the white means those who own it should be careful to avoid stains. 

However, if something does spill on the chair, it is easily washed off with a clean cloth. This chair is great for storage, too. Six chairs can be stacked on each other to save space. This chair is also affordable at $25.

Because of its affordability, people can buy this chair for the home, but also for big events like graduation or birthday parties. The chairs add a certain elegance to every room they are in. And, they’re super comfortable. This chair is easy to assemble and a genuine crowd pleaser. No one can go wrong with the Teodores chair.
