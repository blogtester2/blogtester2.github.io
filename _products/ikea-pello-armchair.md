The IKEA Pello Armchair is a great chair for every room in the house. It’s durable, comfortable, and modern. It has a wood frame, and a cushion to make it extra lush. The product is sustainable, too. The wood is strong and renewable, and the cushion is made of recycled cotton.

This armchair is great for lounging and relaxing. The chair is designed diagonally so those who sit in it can recline back. This chair is great for the bedroom and living room, as well as the patio.

The chair comes in a subtle cream color, so it will match everything. The best part about the Pello Armchair is that it is affordable; it’s only $49.99.
