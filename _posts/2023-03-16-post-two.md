Whether you're working from home or commuting to the office — or both — you should be sitting in one of the best office chairs. We spend so much time at work (maybe too much), so we might as well be as comfortable as possible while we're there.

But the best office chairs are about more than just comfort. By providing the right support, encouraging good posture, and conforming to your body, they can help prevent strain and injury. 

According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (opens in new tab), "A good chair provides necessary support to the back, legs, buttocks, and arms, while reducing exposures to awkward postures, contact stress, and forceful exertions."

To come up with our list of the best office chairs, we've spent hundreds of hours sitting in all the chairs on this page to see how they hold up to the rigors of office life.  In addition to their comfort, we also evaluate the chairs based on their design, adjustability and value to see which would be the best for you.

Of course, a good chair is just one part of a safe and productive home office. To that end, you'll also want to check out our guides to the best standing desks and the best desk lamps to make sure your work environment is comfortable and well-lit.

## Branch Ergonomic Chair

While sleeker than most other office chairs, there's nothing overly flashy about the Branch Ergonomic Chair, and maybe that's a good thing. Once I settled into this $300 office chair, I largely forgot about it as I sat on it while working from home. But isn't that the point of any good office chair?

The Branch Ergonomic Chair has seven adjustment points (the height and width of the armrests, as well as how far forward you want them, seat height, backrest angle, lumbar support, and position of the seat relative to the backrest). That's not as many as you'll find on more expensive models, such as the Herman Miller Aeron, but it's more than enough for a $300 chair like the Branch. Just as important: all of these adjustment points were easy to change. There's nothing worse than struggling to get a chair to fit just right. 

My only real critique of the Branch chair — if you can call it that — is that its padded seat didn't feel as comfortable as mesh seats on pricier chairs, and is not as breathable. But all in all, this chair delivers excellent value.

## Flash Furniture Mid-Back Office Chair

One reason I liked the Flash Furniture Mid-Back office chair is that, in a sea of black and gray office chairs, it stood out with its bold blue and white color scheme (it's also available in gray, yellow, red, orange, white, and yes, black). 

The price of this chair varies based on the color you choose as well as the style — you can opt for a mid-back, high back, and drafting chair — but ranges from around $120 to $210, making it a very affordable model if you're on a budget. 

However, as with most budget office chairs, the Flash Furniture model isn't very adjustable - you can raise and lower the seat and adjust the tilt tension, but that's it. Still, I found it pretty comfortable when sitting for long periods of time. And, when I was ready to head home for the day, the chair's arms fold up, so that I could tuck it under my desk more easily. If you're looking for a cheap office chair that looks good, this is definitely a model to consider.

## Conclusion

There's no better way — really no other way — to test an office chair unless you sit in them. To evaluate each office chair, we sit in each for a few weeks, and go about our day. We notice not just how comfortable the chair is, but how easy it is to adjust its various features. 

Since no two people are the same, we test the chairs out with a 6-foot male and let other office-mates try them out to see if there are any differences when it comes to overall comfort. 

We also take note of the chair's design, its appearance, and how much you can customize it; some chairs can be configured with different materials, colors, and rollers, so you can really make it your own.

Lastly, we take into account the overall cost of the chair and how it compares to others in its price range.
